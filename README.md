# Details

To use api's you should use registered users. Some apis cannot be used by ordinary users (such as addNewBook, getOrdersByDateInterval, changeOrderStatus), admins can use all apis. It is possible to register a new user via signup api. However, you can use pre registered users.  Admin username: "admin", password: "password123". Ordinary user: "ali", password: "123456'
